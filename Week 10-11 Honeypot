## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the assignment.
I was not able to launch the web browser to look up the Dionaea, which will be used to capture the attacks against our vulnerable honeypot. I tried launching both the mhm-admin, and the honeypot-1. I tried again asking for help on the codepath slack channel but after a few days I feel like there is nothing else I can do in my part.
