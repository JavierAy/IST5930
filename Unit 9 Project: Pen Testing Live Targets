For this week we were given two websites (which are identical) that each had a /green, /blue, and /red version in order to pentest and see we can determine which 
vulnerabilities belong to each version of the websites.
We had to poke at each one and by order of elimination figure out which one was preconfigured with a vulnerability.

On the /red site I saw that there was the ability to attack the URL and change the users page, with changing the 'id' number to something that it should normally not 
allow a user to see unless they are signed in. For example, I went from user 1 to user 11 without being logged in and this is a problem because the public shouldn't
have access to user accounts without permission, let a lone log in credentials.

For the /green website I was able to confirm that it was vulnverable to a reflective XSS attack. This occurs because the website is not sanitizing any input entered 
by the user, in this case it is taking any form of codee and executing it. I types a very shor script that read: <script>alert('Javier found the XSS!');</script>, after
reloading the page, the script is shown on the screen in a prompt.
